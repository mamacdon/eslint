eslint-orion
============
This is a fork of [ESLint](https://github.com/nzakas/eslint/) which adds these extra features:

* *Browser friendly*
Where necessary, ESLint has been patched to allow easy conversion with 
[browserify](http://browserify.org/). This means no reliance on Node's synchronous IO.

Also check out the downstream repo [eslint-plugin](https://github.com/mamacdon/eslint-plugin),
which packages a browserified version of this repo as an Eclipse Orion 
[plugin](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/How_Tos/Writing_a_plugin#What_is_a_plugin.3F) that runs 
in the browser.
